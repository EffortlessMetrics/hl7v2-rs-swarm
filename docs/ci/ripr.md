# ripr Static Mutation-Exposure Lane

`ripr` is an advisory PR-time static mutation-exposure lane for `hl7v2-rs`.

## Doctrine

`ripr` is static mutation-exposure analysis.

It catches much of the same signal mutation testing catches: weak test or
oracle exposure. It catches that signal earlier and cheaper because it runs
statically and can run per PR.

Mutation testing remains the slower runtime backstop for what static analysis
cannot prove. `ripr` shifts mutation signal left; it does not make mutation
testing unnecessary.

## Current Role

The initial lane is advisory:

- run on pull requests touching Rust code, `xtask`, Cargo files, `ripr.toml`,
  or the `ripr` policy ledger;
- emit portable PR evidence, review guidance, annotation, summary, and
  impacted-evidence artifacts;
- avoid branch-protection blocking until calibration data exists;
- use suppressions only through a policy ledger;
- preserve runtime mutation as targeted or release-time proof.

The first calibration pass over hosted PR artifacts is recorded in
[`docs/audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-15.md`](../audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-15.md).
A later post-parity traffic sample is recorded in
[`docs/audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-17.md`](../audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-17.md).
The support-bundle and Python-proof traffic sample is recorded in
[`docs/audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-18.md`](../audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-18.md).
The dirty-corpus and evidence-parity guard traffic sample is recorded in
[`docs/audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-20.md`](../audits/ripr-calibration-2026-05-20.md).
Those audits keep `ripr` advisory: severe-gap, annotation, stale-artifact, and
impacted-evidence output can route review and targeted mutation, but branch
protection must not depend on `ripr` until artifact counter semantics, traffic
patterns, and the observed cost/latency envelope are better understood.

## CI Economics

At industrialized PR volume, broad always-on runtime mutation would become an
ordinary PR tax. `ripr` is the cheaper PR-time signal for mutation exposure.
It should identify weak oracle exposure early while targeted runtime mutation
continues to cover what static analysis cannot prove.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make `ripr` required by branch protection in the first lane.
- Do not use `ripr` as a reason to remove mutation testing.
- Do not put full runtime mutation on ordinary PRs.
- Do not hide skipped mutation lanes as passed.
- Do not add suppressions without ownership and review.

## Artifacts

```text
.github/workflows/ripr.yml
ripr.toml
policy/ripr-suppressions.toml
target/ripr/pr/repo-exposure.json
target/ripr/pr/repo-exposure.md
target/ripr/pr/summary.md
target/ripr/review/comments.json
target/ripr/review/comments.md
target/ripr/review/annotations.txt
target/xtask/badges/ripr.json
target/xtask/badges/ripr-plus.json
target/xtask/impacted-evidence/latest.json
target/xtask/impacted-evidence/latest.md
```

The workflow installs `ripr` 0.5.0 with Cargo, runs the repo-local `xtask`
verification commands, emits a stable PR evidence summary, and uploads the
artifacts as `ripr-pr-evidence`. The lane remains advisory: findings route
review and mutation decisions, while contract/tooling drift is the failure mode
to repair.

If the workflow fails because `badges/ripr.json` or `badges/ripr-plus.json` is
stale, regenerate the public badge endpoints with
`cargo run -p xtask -- badges`, rerun `cargo run -p xtask -- badges --check`,
and commit only the resulting `badges/` endpoint diff. This is repository
evidence-artifact drift, not proof that product behavior changed and not a
runtime mutation result.

Do not treat any single artifact as the whole truth. The initial calibration
found that `repo-exposure.json` summary counters and generated Markdown review
guidance can use different counter semantics. Reviewer decisions should inspect
the summary, comments, annotations, and impacted-evidence receipt together.
