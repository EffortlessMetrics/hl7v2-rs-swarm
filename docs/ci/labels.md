# CI Labels

Labels on a pull request override the default routing decisions made by the PR Plan. Applying
a label triggers the corresponding expensive or deep validation lane without requiring CI
workflow changes.

## Label Inventory

| `ci-budget-override`   | Override the hard LEM ceiling (>125 LEM)                        |
| `mutation`             | Run mutation testing (separate from ripr)                       |
| `evidence`             | Run evidence bundle replay and schema fixture validation         |

## Adding a Label

Labels are added in the GitHub UI on the PR sidebar. No CI file changes are needed.

## Label + Branch Protection

Labels do not change which jobs are *required* by branch protection. In the
source repository, `Fast Checks` is the current required check while
`PR Gate Success` remains the intended normalized target. In the swarm
repository, the future required check is `HL7v2 Rust Small Result` after CX53,
CX43 fallback, and GitHub-hosted fallback are all proven. Optional lanes
triggered by labels are never blocking unless branch protection is explicitly
changed.

## Label Governance

Label usage is tracked in `policy/ci-lane-whitelist.toml` under the `labels` field of each
lane entry. Introducing a new label requires adding it to the whitelist and documenting it here.
