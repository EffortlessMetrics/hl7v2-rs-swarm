# Python TestPyPI Release Proof

Use this guide when you need to prove the `hl7v2` distribution as a Python
package before any production PyPI release. This lane is separate from the Rust
primary product graph.

## Package Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Python distribution | `hl7v2` |
| Python import module | `hl7v2` |
| Rust backend crate | `hl7v2-python` PyO3 backend |
| crates.io publish policy | `hl7v2-python` is publishable only as a governed binding backend; backend publication requires a separate release receipt and does not make it the recommended Rust API |
| TestPyPI workflow | `.github/workflows/python-testpypi.yml` |
| GitHub environment | `testpypi` |

Do not publish `hl7v2-python` as part of TestPyPI proof. The primary Rust
product graph remains `hl7v2`, `hl7v2-server`, and `hl7v2-cli`. Rust users
should depend on `hl7v2`; Python users should install/import `hl7v2`.

## One-Time TestPyPI Setup

Use TestPyPI Trusted Publishing. Do not add repository tokens unless a separate
security review chooses token-based publishing.

Configure a pending publisher in TestPyPI with:

| TestPyPI field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Project name | `hl7v2` |
| Owner | `EffortlessMetrics` |
| Repository name | `hl7v2-rs` |
| Workflow filename | `python-testpypi.yml` |
| Environment name | `testpypi` |

In GitHub, create an environment named `testpypi`. Add reviewer protection if
you want a second human confirmation before upload.

## Local Wheel Proof

Run the policy rail before the manual TestPyPI workflow:

```powershell
cargo run -p xtask -- check-python-publish-policy
```

Then run the local wheel proof:

```powershell
cargo +1.95.0 run -p xtask -- python-local-wheel-proof
```

Expected result:

```text
hl7v2 smoke ok version=<version> segments=2
```

The command creates a scratch virtual environment, builds the `hl7v2` wheel with
maturin, installs that wheel, imports `hl7v2`, verifies that
`hl7v2.__version__` matches the workspace package version, and runs
`tests/python_smoke/smoke.py`, `tests/python_smoke/evidence_workflow_guide.py`,
and `tests/python_smoke/dirty_evidence_workflow.py`.
It is a local wheel proof only; TestPyPI success still requires upload and
install-back from TestPyPI.

After TestPyPI upload succeeds, the install-back smoke can also be reproduced
from a source checkout with:

```powershell
cargo +1.95.0 run -p xtask -- python-public-registry-proof --index testpypi --version <workspace version>
```

That command creates a scratch virtual environment, installs
`hl7v2==<workspace version>` from `https://test.pypi.org/simple/` with
`--no-deps --only-binary :all: --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall`, imports
`hl7v2`, verifies `hl7v2.__version__ == <workspace version>`, and runs the
same three Python smoke/evidence scripts. It is a TestPyPI install-back proof
only after the package is actually visible on TestPyPI; it is not a production
PyPI claim.

## Manual TestPyPI Proof

Run the **Python TestPyPI Proof** workflow manually.

First run with:

```text
publish_to_testpypi = false
diagnose_trusted_publisher = false
```

This builds the wheel, installs it into a fresh virtual environment, runs the
Python smoke test, evidence workflow guide, and dirty evidence workflow smoke,
and uploads the wheel as a short-retention artifact. It does not publish.

The current hosted non-publishing proof passed on `main` after the v1.5.0
release and public `hl7v2` package retarget; see
[`docs/audits/python-testpypi-nonpublish-proof-2026-05-15.md`](../audits/python-testpypi-nonpublish-proof-2026-05-15.md).

If the TestPyPI Trusted Publisher setup still needs diagnosis, run the same
workflow from `main` with:

```text
publish_to_testpypi = false
diagnose_trusted_publisher = true
```

That route enters the `testpypi` GitHub environment, requests the same
`audience=pypi` OIDC token used by Trusted Publishing, records the decoded
publisher claims in the job summary, and skips the upload step. It is useful
for confirming the actual GitHub `sub` claim without creating or overwriting a
TestPyPI release. It does not prove TestPyPI upload or install-back.

After the local wheel proof and non-publishing workflow pass, rerun with:

```text
publish_to_testpypi = true
diagnose_trusted_publisher = false
```

Run publishing mode from `main`. The workflow fails early if
`publish_to_testpypi=true` is selected from any other ref.

Before upload, the publish job writes both the expected TestPyPI Trusted
Publisher fields and the actual decoded GitHub OIDC publisher claims to the
GitHub Actions job summary. It fails before upload if the actual `sub`,
`repository`, `environment`, or `ref` does not match the expected
trusted-publisher identity.

If the upload still fails with `invalid-publisher` after the actual `sub` is
`repo:EffortlessMetrics/hl7v2-rs:environment:testpypi`, the GitHub side is
presenting the right identity and TestPyPI still needs the pending publisher
configuration for project `hl7v2`. Fix TestPyPI before rerunning. Do not switch
to a repository token or `skip-existing` as a shortcut around Trusted
Publishing.

This does three things:

1. Builds and smoke-tests the wheel.
2. Publishes the wheel to TestPyPI using Trusted Publishing.
3. Installs `hl7v2==<workspace version>` back from TestPyPI in a fresh
   virtual environment and reruns `tests/python_smoke/smoke.py`,
   `tests/python_smoke/evidence_workflow_guide.py`, and
   `tests/python_smoke/dirty_evidence_workflow.py`.

The hosted install-back job runs the same proof boundary as the local
reproduction command:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- python-public-registry-proof --index testpypi --version "${PACKAGE_VERSION}"
```

This keeps the workflow proof and local reproduction path aligned. A passing
install-back job proves only the TestPyPI package for the selected version; it
does not claim production PyPI availability.

TestPyPI does not allow overwriting an existing file for the same version. If
the upload fails because the version already exists, stop and choose a new
workspace version for the next proof attempt. Do not use `skip-existing` for
release proof, because that can accidentally test an older artifact.

## Stop Conditions

A TestPyPI proof is complete only when all of these are true:

- The local wheel proof passes.
- The manual workflow with `publish_to_testpypi=false` passes.
- The manual workflow with `publish_to_testpypi=true` uploads the current
  version to TestPyPI.
- The install-back job installs from `https://test.pypi.org/simple/` and runs
  `tests/python_smoke/smoke.py`,
  `tests/python_smoke/evidence_workflow_guide.py`, and
  `tests/python_smoke/dirty_evidence_workflow.py` successfully.
- Optional local reproduction with
  `cargo +1.95.0 run -p xtask -- python-public-registry-proof --index testpypi --version <workspace version>`
  also installs from TestPyPI and runs the same smoke scripts.

This is still not a production PyPI release. Treat it as packaging evidence for
the separate Python lane. A crates.io binding-backend publish, if later
approved, does not replace TestPyPI upload and install-back proof.

After the upload/install-back proof passes, use
[Python PyPI Release](python-pypi-release.md) for the guarded production PyPI
release path.

Current status: the non-publishing proof is complete for public package
`hl7v2`. A 2026-05-10 publishing-mode run from `main` built and
smoke-tested the wheel, then failed during Trusted Publishing token exchange
with `invalid-publisher`; see
[docs/audits/python-testpypi-publish-attempt-2026-05-10.md](../audits/python-testpypi-publish-attempt-2026-05-10.md).
A 2026-05-17 publishing-mode run at commit
`764647e79ab61cd9814d07a777cbf1eed27a5ee8` again built and smoke-tested the
wheel successfully, then failed at the same Trusted Publishing exchange
boundary with `repo:EffortlessMetrics/hl7v2-rs:environment:testpypi`; see
[docs/audits/python-testpypi-publish-attempt-2026-05-17.md](../audits/python-testpypi-publish-attempt-2026-05-17.md).
Current `main` has since added the shared public-registry proof command,
hosted install-back routing, parity-manifest registry boundaries, and the
current parity gap audit without rerunning the upload, because external
Trusted Publisher setup remains unproven.
The TestPyPI upload/install-back proof remains incomplete until the TestPyPI
Trusted Publisher is configured for project `hl7v2` and a rerun passes. Track
the external setup blocker in
[#563](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/hl7v2-rs/issues/563).
